## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
Lab 1 was my favorite and first ever computer science lab I ever did. It opened my point of view about computer science and how it introduced me to what coding is capable of. It was my first time doing a lab that took me so many hours to  just ot complete.   


Lab 7 part 2
Lab 7 was where I started to have the idea about coding and what it could achieve. Especially lab 7 part 2 because it was one of the first project labs that was fun and interesting. When I  created coding with configuration  that was supposed to give the command to the system to play blackjack. 

Lab 12 part 2
Lab 12 part 2 was one of my favorite labs out of all the labs because it shows the skill that we achieve in coding. And it was amazing to create a colorful image with text in the middle. It was very intriguing to discover what coding could do.
